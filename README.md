# Bluebird Playground

Test the behavior of bluebird, as the documentation is difficult to read.

## Reference

A cheatsheet which is easy to read and understand: http://ricostacruz.com/cheatsheets/bluebird.html

## Note

- Promise.method() for define class function, no need to handle this
- Promise.try() handle the error promise
- Promise.value() prevent nesting when need to use early variable

## TODO

.bind() with class?
.tap() and .then()
try .call()

.return() wait until the execution is done?
